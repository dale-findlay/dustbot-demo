System Overview
AiM includes implementations of various Artificial Intelligence techniques.
Features
Pathfinding:
A* pathfinding
Dijkstra’s pathfinding
Behaviour Management
Behavior Trees
Blackboards
Flocking
Avoidance
Other
Finite State Machines
Purpose
Offer an easily implemented completely modular AI library that provides all the necessary functionality to distributed as an open source framework linked dynamically.

Project Linkage
This project will be linked dynamically as a dll into a project. But the source code can also be added compiled into the project to achieve the same functionality.
Requirements
This library only requires a small mathematics library (glm) in order to function and a library for parsing obj files.

Feature Implementations
Pathfinding
The pathfinding component of the library will include implementations of the following pathfinding algorithms:

A* Pathfinding
Dijkstra’s Pathfinding Algorithm

Behavior Management
The behavior management component of the library will implement various tools for creating complex behavior systems.

The following techniques are to be implemented:
Behaviour trees
Blackboards
Various Steering Behaviours.
Flocking
A simple flocking system will be implemented that takes into account configured avoidance volumes.
Other Techniques & Utilities
There will also be a number of other utilities and classes implemented for both internal and external use.
