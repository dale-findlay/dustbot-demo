# Dustbot Demo Requirements

You'll need mono installed on your machine to run the demo in visual studio.

Here's a link to the installer:
https://download.mono-project.com/archive/5.14.0/windows-installer/mono-5.14.0.177-x64-0.msi

It has to get installed to this dir: C:\Program Files\Mono\

If you already have a version of mono installed you should be good to compile.
